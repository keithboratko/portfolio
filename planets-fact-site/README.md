# Planet Facts Website

![Design preview for the Planets fact site coding challenge](./preview.jpg)


## Overview

The Planet Facts website is an interactive multi-page application that provides users with detailed information about various planets in our solar system. The website is designed to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Features

- **Interactive Navigation**: Users can click on category buttons to display different facts about the selected planet, including its geology and images.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts based on the screen size, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on any device.
- **Dynamic Content Update**: The planet images and facts update dynamically based on user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling, including:
  - **Flexbox**: For flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
  - **Root Variables**: To maintain consistent styling and simplify theme adjustments.
  - **Media Queries**: For responsive design to ensure usability across devices.
- **JavaScript**: 
  - Event handling for interactive elements.
  - DOM manipulation to update content dynamically.
  
## Concepts Demonstrated

- **Event Handling**: Using `addEventListener` to handle user interactions.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Selecting and modifying HTML elements based on user actions.
- **Conditional Logic**: Implementing conditions to display different content based on user selection.
- **Responsive Design Principles**: Employing flexbox and media queries to create a user-friendly interface across various devices.
- **Encapsulation and Modularity**: Structuring code into separate functions for better organization and maintainability.

## Lessons Learned

- **Understanding Flexbox**: Gaining proficiency in flexbox layout has enhanced my ability to create responsive designs quickly and efficiently.
- **Dynamic Content Management**: Learning how to manipulate the DOM to create interactive experiences deepened my understanding of JavaScript's capabilities.
- **User Experience Focus**: Designing with mobile-first principles taught me the importance of usability and accessibility in web design.
- **Code Organization**: Structuring my JavaScript into modular functions improved the readability and maintainability of my code.
